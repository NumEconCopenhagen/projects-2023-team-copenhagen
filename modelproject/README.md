# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cournot Project** that applies for a market of the structure of a duopoly in which each firm chooses the quantity they want to supply to a demand. In order to solve this we suppose two firms with symetric costs functions and also the production of homogeneous goods..

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
