# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Cournot Project** that applies for a market of the structure of a duopoly in which each firm chooses the quantity they want to supply to a demand. In order to solve this we suppose two firms with symetric costs functions and also the production of homogeneous goods..

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [cournot.ipynb](cournot.ipynb).
About the file of the function of the code, [cournot1.py](cournot1.py) refers fixed output of one firm, then [cournot2.py](cournot2.py) refers Nash-equilibrium. Finally [merge_cournot.py](merge_cournot.py) refers the condition that two firms are merged.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
